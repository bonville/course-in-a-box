## Open Data: Data Equity for Main Street

Data Equity for Main Street is a grant-based project to promote data literacy by training librarians and community members how to find, use and give feedback about open data. What is open data, why does it matter, and how is it used?  This work has been made possible through a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and by a talented and passionate community of supporters who have helped write, edit and present it.

As the open data movement matures, we must ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate in the benefits that it creates: more informed public decisions, new businesses and new projects. Organizations with large budgets and people with advanced technical skills will more readily find and use this information; smaller groups and less technical people will need help getting started. Public librarians are skilled, trusted professionals embedded in urban and rural, large and small communities across the country, so it makes sense to integrate open data training and knowledge into libraries. By both empowering librarians with the knowledge to find and use open data, and creating tools for libraries to teach their communities to find and use open data, this project will build foundational learning materials in which everyone shares in the benefit and promise of open data.
How to use this curriculum
The curriculum and teaching guide that follows is intended to help community members and organizations learn about how to find and use open data. 

This curriculum is a six to eight hour training divided across four classes. Libraries can add these hands-on open data lesson plans to existing digital and information literacy programs, or offer them as stand-alone classes or workshops. These lessons will help members of the community and community organizations learn what open data is, how to find it, easy ways to use it, and why it is important to provide feedback to the governments and organizations that created the data. These lesson plans focus on where to find data, how to leverage existing tools and where to find potential partners that local organizations can contact if they need help analyzing or visualizing data in different ways.

Each Class is divided into several sections (1a, 1b, 1c, etc.). Each section has the following components:
Estimated Time for Completion: The average amount of time required to complete the section
Learning Objective: What each learner will know or be able to do by the end of that section
Discussion: Overview of the activities and notes for any lecture section of the class as well as suggestions based on our experience teaching the material 
Activities: Videos or hands-on learning exercises 
Alternate Activities (if applicable): Activities that either may require fewer technology resources or that learners who finish the basic material can undertake 

A list of any handouts needed appears at the end of the final section for each class.  

Those instructors already comfortable with open data may be able to simply familiarize themselves with the curriculum before teaching it. Others should take our open data training class for librarians. Feel free to use the curriculum in whole or in part, but please bear in mind that the sessions build upon each other and are designed to be completed sequentially.

## Evaluations
We are very excited about your feedback. We have created both student and instructor evaluations and ask that you complete these at the at end of each class. You can use either paper forms or the online survey. If you choose to use the paper forms, please transcribe the data into the google form. Links to paper and digital evaluations are located here: https://goo.gl/PXZRsw. 
Materials Needed 
For all classes, we recommend having access to a projector or large monitor, instructor laptop and timekeeping device, screen, speakers, student computers (at least 1:2) and internet access. The curriculum assumes some technology access and knowledge, and provides alternative activities for classes that have access to additional resources or classes that have more limited resources. Because open data is updated regularly, instructors should check links before class starts. The Data Equity website will provide alternative datasets to replace those that are no longer up-to-date. 

## Class Norms
If you do not already have standard guidelines for your classes, the following may be helpful. Ask learners to mute cell phones; allow people to stand, stretch, or excuse themselves for a few minutes; treat others respectfully and allow for differences of opinion; allow each participant an opportunity to speak without interruption.
